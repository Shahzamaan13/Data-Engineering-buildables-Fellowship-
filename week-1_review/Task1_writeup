In this project, I learned how to design relational tables, insert sample data, and write advanced SQL queries. 
I practiced important SQL concepts such as aggregations, joins, window functions, views, indexes, and CTEs.

The most interesting part was using window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, SUM OVER) to calculate rankings and cumulative values, 
because they allow solving complex analytical problems efficiently.

The hardest part was writing queries with CTEs and window functions, since it requires careful use of PARTITION BY and ORDER BY. 
Once understood, it became clear how powerful they are for real-world analytics.

This assignment improved my confidence in SQL analytics, data modeling, and optimization techniques.
