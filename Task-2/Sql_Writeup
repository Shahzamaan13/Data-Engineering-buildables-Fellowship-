Difference between OLTP and OLAP modeling:

OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):

Used for day-to-day operations, like inserting, updating, deleting transactions.

Focused on speed and accuracy of transactions.

Highly normalized schema to avoid data redundancy.

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):

Used for analysis and reporting, like revenue trends, top customers.

Focused on query performance and aggregations.

Often uses star or snowflake schemas with denormalized dimensions.

Why surrogate keys are important in dimensions:

Surrogate keys are system-generated unique IDs (like customer_sk) instead of using natural/business keys.

Important for SCD Type-2 to track history, because same customer may have multiple records over time.

Surrogate keys ensure stable, unique, numeric identifiers that do not change when business data changes.

Helps in joining fact and dimension tables efficiently.
